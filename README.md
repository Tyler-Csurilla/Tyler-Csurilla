##  About

Writing code is my profession and my primary hobby. I enjoy working with front-end and back-end code to build things I'm proud of.


### Languages I prefer:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C#
---

- I am a fan of creating generative art and simulations
- I like to work with Angular and React primarily for the front-end. 
- Love experimenting with newer back-end technologies, but you can never discount the classics.
